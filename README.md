#Logistics and Warehouse Management System
Technology continues to disrupt logistics and supply chain processes by changing it altogether from its core. Consequently, logistics became more refined and fast, which changed the way how materials, goods, freight, sales orders, inventory, and production are managed.
As efficiency and speed became the determining factors, logistics adopted a new approach to deal with the rising demand and complexity of processes. A viable solution that manages the flow of things so that the right product reaches the customer within the specified time.  
With the use of logistics systems, the entire base of logistical operations was streamlined that took away the hassles involved in the process. Organizations that invested in logistics management software have produced good end results with noticeable improvements in process, operations, and delivery.
Logistics involve the flow of things from its point of origin to the point of consumption usually general customers or businesses. The selection of vendors, transportation means, routes and delivery methods constitute an important part of logistical operations.
Logistics management is a part of the supply chain that uses planning and implementation to store and deliver goods and services to the customer. It coordinates several key activities of the supply chain that ranges from the development of the product to its commercialization.
With Logistics Management System, a company could avail the following benefits.
1.	Refine Transportation – Transportation being a pivotal area of logistics incurs the most charges in the form of fuel, energy, labor, tolls and shipping fees. Relying on logistics software can help manage the various transportation means and leverage the data to automate the process. This allows for easy analysis, which a company can utilize to make relevant decisions for maximizing efficiency and reducing costs.
2.	Faster Delivery – Logistics being a linear flow of goods and services come across several issues that affect delivery and cause delays. By incorporating a logistics software, a singular benefit that businesses derive is in the faster delivery of products to the customers. A logistics management software can improve the speeds in delivery by interfering in the production cycle and selecting the right shipping service, which cuts short any delays to a large extent.
3.	Minimize Human Errors – The other notable advantage of having a logistics management software is in reducing human error. Analysis of transportation data results in huge quantities of data that is difficult, time-consuming and prone to errors when processed manually. A logistics software can process these data without any errors in less time, which will seamlessly push forward the operations with zero chances of delays.
4.	Automates Functions – Automation is another boon to integrating a logistics software to deal with the processes. Certain functions like creating shipment routes, load planning, and tendering of load to carriers are easily automated and managed by using a logistics software. Moreover, it eliminates paperwork, which helps deal with the processes in a more efficient and timely manner.
5.	Reduce Costs – Savings is the other end result as the logistics software can automatically compare different shipping services, delivery agents and transportation methods to find ones with the least pricing. The other way by which a logistics software reduces costs is by lowering the expedited shipments through improved planning of the shipments.
Scope of this Project
In this project, we intend to work with sellers of all kinds of products all over the world. Our responsiblility is to take care of warehousing of the product. The seller will ship the product directly to our warehouse address and place advert of the product anywhere he/she likes, though can also plase the advert on our website, but the selling aspect will be take care of by the seller. Once the seller make sales, he/she will just issue receipt which will also be referenced to us, then send a picker to our warehouse to pick the product for final delivery to the buyer, though he/she has the option of making use of our delivery service at some reasonable cost.
So the following will be done in the first face of the project:
-	The seller will be able to register on the website.
-	The seller will be able to send the shipment details and tracking number to us.
-	He will be able to login to the website and sees his/her profile.
-	The seller will also be able to monitor the status of the prodect shipped weither it is still in transit or already in our warehouse.
-	The admin will also be able to login as admin and update the status of the products.
